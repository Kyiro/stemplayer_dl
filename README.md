# stemplayer-dl

stemplayer-dl is a project that allows you to dump all the existing songs.

## Setup
Change the base path name in utils.py if you do not want it to be Dump

## Issues
Cannot merge songs into 1, due to my laziness, if you want to do it, send a pull request :)

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. 

Kano, if you aren't okay with this send me a message and I will delete the repo :)
